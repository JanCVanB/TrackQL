# TrackQL Vue Client

This is a client for [TrackQL](https://github.com/JanCVanB/TrackQL).

This client is made with:
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for reactivity and simplicity
- [vue-apollo](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-apollo) for Vue-Apollo integration
- [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) for GraphQL queries
- [Pug](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) for HTML pre-processing
- [Sass](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) for CSS pre-processing
- [Yarn](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) for dependency management
